Result: Blackscreen\n  -> Changing the DirectX version from 10 to 9 in the Game's config. Result: Blackscreen\n  -> Launching the Game in a Virtual Desktop. Result: Blackscreen, but mouse was permanently locked in-bounds to only a small portion of the Window.\n\nThere seems to be no fix or Workaround for this issue as of yet.\nThis game runs fine with regular Wine-Staging however.",
