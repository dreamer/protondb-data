    "notes": "Input is broken, but I figured out a workaround.  Controller inputs register for both Player 1 and Player 2 simultaneously, and there is no way to unmap the controller from P2.  As a result, if you hit start (mapped to the controller Back button by default), the game will start for both P1 and P2 and you will control inputs for both players with the same controller.  When I connect two xinput-compatible controllers, the second controller is simply ignored by the game.\n\nThe workaround is simply this: map the P2 \"start\" button to an unused button, like the left bumper button. \n\nI gave a Silver rating because you cannot unmap P2 controls due to the input weirdness, therefore you cannot play a local versus match.\n\nOther than that, graphics are fine and sound is fine.  I was not willing to attempt an online match because of the input issue and potentially wasting someone's time.",
