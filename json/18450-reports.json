    "notes": "The \"Crazy Machines 1.5\" entry fails to launch due to a missing executable. However, the separate \"DLC\" entries work fine. Just like Crazy Machines 1.0, there are some problems with \"Z-fighting\" glitchy textures that don't exist on Windows. Game is very playable though. Marking as Bronze because 1 out of 3 entries in Steam don't even launch.",
