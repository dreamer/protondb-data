Touching video options ingame will crash the game instantly (does not save settings), and touching video options in title screen will cause game to crash when you start new game or load save (saves settings). When changed settings are saved, game shows error box about not being able to save config and any further attemps to start game will fail (window with a black screen). This can be fixed by removing (configuration from) Proton prefix. However, default settings seem to be just fine as there are no video or controller issues and game is playable and stable, you just lack the high quality preset.",
