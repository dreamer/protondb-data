With the \"PROTON_NO_D3D11\" tweak, nothing happened at all. With the \"PROTON_USE_WINED3D11\" tweak, the game actually tried to run, but the window didn't actually display the game at all, instead displaying a really distorted version of my desktop and other open windows. I had to kill the process to close it.",
