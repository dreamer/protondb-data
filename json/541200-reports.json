    "notes": "Works well, but fps is lower then it must be. DO NOT change settings in game - that's will affect performance. For example: if you played well on height settings on 60-40 FPS and then switch to medium or low - you'll get like 20-40 FPS on ANY settings. One more thing: do not minimize window when in fullscreen - controls stop working.",
