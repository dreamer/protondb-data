    "notes": "I was able to manage to get this game running. First, you have to google and download the specific java version that is required (at least the 1.6.0 version). Then once it's downloaded, go to where the java download is at and right click the outside of the download folder and click the open in terminal option. Type in the terminal for example: (WINEPREFIX=\"/home/username/.steam/steamapps/compatdata/202530/pfx\" WINEARCH=win64 wine jre-6u45-windows-i586.exe) and install java. After that, use the terminal again to type for example: (WINEPREFIX=\"/home/username/.steam/steamapps/compatdata/202530/pfx\" WINEARCH=win64 winetricks) From there, install msxml3, vcrun2010, and maybe d3dx9. Disable esync (PROTON_NO_ESYNC=1 %command%). Once done, the game should work. ",
