    "notes": "Runs in software mode only due to NVIDIA ION GPU being incompatible with Vulkan enabled NVIDIA drivers. May work with hardware acceleration on other systems with supported video cards. Often starts with a non refreshing loading screen requiring closing Steam and trying again. Custom cursor only works in full screen mode and is very slow. Using Alt+Tab causes the game to freeze. Otherwise the game is perfectly playable using all modes with 100% performance in full screen and window mode on a 2010 Intel Atom CPU. Given the above, there are no graphical or audio issues.",
