Opening the ingame menu (that can be opened with the Alt key by default) is tricky. I have to press the shortcut for returning to Desktop and the Alt key repeatedly to get access to the ingame menu.\nThe performance is (even) worse than on Windows. Some objects (mostly poles for some reason) were not rendered. Some traffic signs were floating in the air. Loading the last situation does not work. Real weather does not work either. The steering wheel worked immediately but without force feedback.\nApart from those minor problems, the game runs fine. I have not experienced a single crash yet.\n(I also recommend to install the 4 GB patch which can be done using the CFF explorer in wine.)",
