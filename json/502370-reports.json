To fix that one need to apply fix described in https://forum.winehq.org/viewtopic.php?f=8&t=30764 1. Go to <steam-library</steamapps/compatdata/502370/pfx/drive_c/users/steamuser/My Documents/My Games/SANCTUS. Open OPTIONS.TXT. 3. Change RezX to your horizontal resolution (mine is RezX 1920). 4. Change RezY to your vertical resolution (mine is RezX 1080). 5. Change Fullscreen to 0. After that the game can be run. I hadn't observed any issues, although it was my first play ever. If you don't find an OPTIONS.TXT where it should be, just create it and paste in the content from here: https://pastebin.com/RzYeqSCN. This fix seems to work for many Slitherine made wargames.  ",
