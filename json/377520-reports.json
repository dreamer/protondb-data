Change the resolution to your liking.\n\nAfter that you have to configure wine using this in a terminal:\nWINEPREFIX=\"<your steam folder>/steamapps/compatdata/377520/pfx\"; winecfg\n\nIn the configuration go to the \"Libraries tab\", then add \"dbghelp\" (without quotes) to the overrides list, using the \"edit\" button, set it to wine (builtin).\nClick \"OK\", then launch the game. \n\nEverything should run smoothly.",
