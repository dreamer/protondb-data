    "notes": "Yes, bypassing the launcher as suggested here before works as intended. Game \"gamma\" are a bit dark, but not unplayable dark, probably due to Mesa driver problems or game problem. Just need adjusting monitor brightness and you good to go.\n\nTo bypass the launcher (refined for Linux newbie):\n1. Open The Sims(TM) 3 \"Bin\" directory in Nautilus/File Manager (default is on /home/yourusername/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/The Sims 3/Game/Bin)\n2. Find Sims3Launcher.exe and rename it to SimsLauncher.exe.old\n3. Open \"Bin\" directory in Terminal and create a symlink to TS3.exe by typing either \"ln -s TS3.exe Sims3Launcher.exe\" or \"ln -s Sims3Launcher.exe TS3.exe\"\n4. You're good to go. Enjoy!",

No need for command line! \n\n(HIGHLY RECOMMENDED) FOR MODS AND CC: the folder for mods isn't in /Documents/Electronic Arts/The Sims 3, due to proton, the folder is in (/home/YOURUSERNAME/.steam/steam/steamapps/compatdata/47890/pfx/drive_c/users/steamuser/My Documents/Electronic Arts/The Sims 3/Mods). This is especially important when installing bug-fixing mods like NRaas ErrorTrap and Overwatch (which I highly recommend for extremely better performance). \n\nDARK SCREEN WORKAROUND: My workaround for the lower screen is to use dedicated shell scripts to lower or higher the brightness. Open up a text editor of your choice, type in (no quotes) \"xgamma -gamma 1.75\" and save it as Higher.sh FILE FORMAT. Save, and do the same again, but this time using 1 instead of 1.75. Name THAT file Normal.sh (not Higher) and save. Don't forget to give these scripts permission to run as programs by right-clicking the scripts, and enabling \"Let this script run as a program.\" That's all! Now you've got TS3!",
