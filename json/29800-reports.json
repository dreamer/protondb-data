    "notes": "Game runs just fine, but there are several issues with the gameplay that I can't say for sure if they are related to SteamPlay/Proton or just vanilla game bugs. In the tutorial level I have to get within point-blank range to shoot the white orbs containing the attack drops. When I finally do blow them up, I collect the drops but they don't add the new attack types to my player, leaving me stuck with only the initial attack. After the tutorial level, it becomes common for the character to get stuck in the ground, leaving me with no option but to jump around to get around. I've never played this native, so I don't know if these are common issues with the game or not.",
