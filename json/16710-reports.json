    "notes": "Menus and UI are all missing/broken. Game starts up to black screen, but you can hear the music playing and if you move the mouse around you can eventually hear when you pass over a button, if you can click on the top of them, you can start the game. Cutscene videos play fine, and other than the missing UI the gameplay itself seems to work just fine.",
