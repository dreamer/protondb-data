Subsequent starts are fast enough. \nComing to performance, it is definitely lower than that of windows. But you may not see the difference with much beefier hardware.

Did not face the missing fonts issue that some people are reporting. There is a noticeable input lag initially but it can be fixed by adding \"WIEDEBUG=-all %command%\" to steam launch options. Some stutters can be removed by setting cpu governors to performance. The very first load time IS LONG but after that it is normal and short. There are some lags initially, but as the game builds it cache the wrinkles get kinked out. \nWith 32 hours into the game now, with the above tweaks, there is no rubber banding, no input lag, and works like a charm.
