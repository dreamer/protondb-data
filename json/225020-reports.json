    "notes": "Game loads a black screen with some sort of settings/launcher window behind it; with alt+tab and enter, one can eventually get into the game and cause it to actually run, but keyboard/mouse input is not accepted - shift+tab into the Steam screen and then back to the game seems to fix this. Once game is running, it seems to run well and without issues. Gamepad untested.",
