You can edit <game directory>/Config/UserConfig.cfg  but changes don't have any effect. Gamepad support is broken. Audio has a broken, repeating effect once getting in game.

    "notes": "By default, the game doesn't launch at all, but in order for the game to run, you need to rename Launcher.exe to something else, and Nights.exe into Launcher.exe, once completed, the game launches in a small window but you can change that in Config/UserConfig.cfg within the game files by setting the resolution to whatever you want.\n\nThe game itself doesn't have any controller support by default (unless if there's a way to change it in Keyboard.cfg), and all of the SFX get repeated over and over, which can be very annoying, but other than that, the game runs smoothly.

    "notes": "Launch option \"PROTON_NO_ESYNC=1 %command%\" fixes the sound issues. The controller also works once you get into the launcher/config-tool, which needs dotnet. You can install .net35 into a 64bit prefix with Wine3.18 (at least). Delete the games \"pfx\" folder (...compatdata/219950/pfx) if it already exits and run: WINEPREFIX=~/.steam/steam/steamapps/compatdata/219950/pfx winecfg. Make sure mono is not installed, set the Windows version to 2003 and add \"mscoree\" as native in the libs tab. Then with the same wineprefix run: wine ~/.steam/steam/steamapps/common/NiGHTS\\ Into\\ Dreams/external/DotNet3_5/dotnetfx35.exe /lang:ENU. Once it's finished, rename the same dotnetfx35.exe to something else, like dotnetfx35.exe.bak, so Steam can't try to install it again later. The DXSETUP.exe can be renamed as well since it is not really needed. Launch the game or right click/'Game Configuration' and it should work.",
