    "notes": "***Only DayZ Offline mode on `experimental - Unstable testing version` branch is working***\n- The game in offline mode works pretty good and out of the box.\n- Performance is mediocre if not terrible (but I don't have Windows atm to compare how bad native performance is ;))\n- Fullscreen/windowed mode works\n- Alt tabbing works (sometimes in windowed mode after minimizing you have to alttab in and out to make it catch the correct resolution)\n- Steam Overlay and Screenshots work\n- But: USB mouse is terribly \"heavy\", it moves veeery slowly (like with very low acceleration, sens. in settings doesn't do much)\n- What's weird - touchpad mouse works just fine\n- Windowed mode runs slightly better, but there is no borderless option\n- You can kinda fix mouse with: \nenv WINEPREFIX=\"/..../steamapps/compatdata/221100/pfx/\" WINEPATH=\"/..../steamapps/common/Proton 3.7/dist/bin/wine64\" winecfg\nAnd in \"Wine Configuration\" -> \"Graphics\" tab ->  enable \"Automatically capture the mouse in full-screen windows\" + enable \"Virtual Desktop\" (e.g. 1920x1080) and mouse after this kinda works fine -> Apply\n- I haven't found zombies during ~30 minutes but suicide works :v Don't know how performance would be on native Windows but it's pretty bad here\n- Trying to play \"normal\" (online) DayZ fails with Battleye error \"Failed to initialize BattlEye Service: Driver Load Error (31)\"\n\nTo sum up: Decided to call it \"Stable\" because it, well, works. But only experimental offline version, performance is mediocre and there are some fixable mouse problems.",
