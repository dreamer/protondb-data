    "notes": "At least one unicode symbol does not display correctly for me (stars in titles). Perhaps one could figure out how to change the font the game uses in order to fix this. I think it uses a system font because the font is different compared to when I ran the game on Windows.\n\nPerformance is grating at times, but let's be honest\u2014this game was never performant\u2014even in Windows. The two biggest performance killers are complicated maps and a large number of mice in the room, both of which are somewhat controllable by the player. It still performs much better than the web version of the game, so I'm happy with it.",
