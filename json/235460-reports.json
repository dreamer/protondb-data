    "notes": "Played in windowed mode, 1280x720. Other graphics settings at default for \"High\" on \"Graphic Quality\" (the master setting). Played through the whole main game, both DLCs, and all VR missions. Beat the main game on every difficulty. 50 hours total playtime. For the most part, everything seemed to work perfectly. Steam was in Offline Mode for most of it (see bug #3). Did not try any tweaks.\n\nBugs encountered:\n\n1. Hitting \"Continue\" after pausing cutscenes only advanced one frame, though you could still \"Skip\" them.\n\n2. Would often get a lot of static on my speakers after playing for a few hours.  Re-launching the game fixed it. I use an Encore USB Audio Box, detected as a \"CM106 Like Sound Device Analog Stero\" (it's chipset or whatever, I assume).  Switching to the onboard audio (Realtek ALC1150) cut down on the amount of static, but didn't prevent the issue.  My OS uses the Pulse Audio Controller that came with it by default.\n\n3. Had my entire system freeze up on me twice during play. Upon resetting and relaunching, the Steam client applied an update (the only times that happened while I was testing this), so apparently that somehow caused it. Had to completely disable my network connection to prevent it since the Steam client will still update even in offline mode.",
