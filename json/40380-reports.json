So, I had to edit the following game file to set the proper screen resolution (open the file with a text editor and search for \"Resolution\"):\n\n<Steam>/steamapps/compatdata/40380/pfx/drive_c/users/steamuser/My Documents/naild/Out/Settings/Video.scr\n\nAfter that, I played a few races with a Xbox 360 Controller and the game ran smoothly with everything maxed out @60fps+ with no apparent issues.",
