    "notes": "It kind of just works, but you'll have to get through the beginning to make it really playable. Sometimes like when loading a new weapon it doesn't show frames for like a second but that stops after like 2-3 minutes. And sounds are maybe not attenuating, but that could just be my impression bc gunshots are generally loud",
