    "notes": "Doesnt Run. You get a black screen and an error message \"Fatal Error\". However, i discovered that it is probably a Codec Problem. There are several people that have fixed that Error Message by simply installing an update called \"Windows Media Pack N\". Also the Readme of the Game says you should check that your \"Windows Media Player\" is up-to-date. So i think it is a sure shot to try it. Problem is... i dont know how to install that \".msu\" file in Linux ^^' But maybe it will help anyone.",
