    "notes": "First one. Paused screen indefinitely on mission launch. Happens rarely, but is solved by verifying integrity of game cache on steam and launching a different normal single mission. Not Naval Academy! \nIt solved it for me anyway.\n\nSecond one: A spinning screen error that's related to mouse sensitivity.  If you've messed with Transformation Matrix values in libinput or xinput to increase mouse sensitivity, then you'll have a spinning screen as soon as you capture the mouse and try to look around.\n\nA solution:\n1. Open the terminal (CTRL+ALT+T) and type: xinput list\nNote the ID number your mouse has. Mine has id=11, and that's what I'm using in this example. *You will have to use your own id number*\n\n2. Type in xinput list-props <id>. \nExample: xinput list-props 11\nThe third row from the top is usually 'Coordinate Transformation Matrix'.  Don't worry about the decimals, unless they're something other than zeroes. The default is 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1, but yours might be different, so write them down. \n\nI had mine set to 2 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 1. That increased my sensitivity to double the default value, but caused the spinning screen issues.\n\n3. Next, type the command: \nxinput set-prop 11 'Coordinate Transformation Matrix' 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1\n\n4. Run the game and enjoy. Once you're done, run the above command and set the numbers in Coordinate Transformation Matrix back to the default.\n\nMods works fine, unless they use an executable to install themselves. In that case, you're going to move all the Silent Hunter 3 files from the steam folders into wine and install the mod there, then move the files back into steam.",
