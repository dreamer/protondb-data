Only one minor issue was found, everything else worked and looked just like it did on windows.\n\nNote on an Error that's present on both WIndows and Linux: The Game starts up with a launcher that lets you configure some options. Aspect Ratio will never be saved, even if you set it again ingame. When changing the aspect Ratio ingame I'd advicew to say the ratio first before selecting Windowed or No-Frame(Borderless), otherwise it can glitch.\nWhen in Fullscreen mode, tabbing out did glitch the game, did not happen on Bordered or No-Frame.",
