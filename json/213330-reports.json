(steamapps/compatdata/213330/pfx) My particular command was: \"WINEPREFIX=/home/mylogin/.steam/steam/steamapps/compatdata/213330/pfx wine DXSETUP.exe\" For some reason when I installed the game it didn't auto-run this installer.\n\nAfter that the game launched but I experienced extremely choppy audio. This was fixed by adding \"PULSE_LATENCY_MSEC=25 %command%\" to the launch options.\n\nQuite often the framerate dipped below 60fps but the game was still totally playable. (This was also at max settings) I played the game to 100% and didn't experience any other problems. Controllers worked perfectly.",
