    "notes": "For some reason setting the graphics to medium seems to result to better performance compared to low. I'm getting 23 FPS on average which is remarkable considering the hardware I'm using. Sometimes I also get freezes that last about a second or less, that doesn't happen very often though.\n\nSo, I'd say that performance is not the best which is to be expected considering the age of my system, but overall I think that the game is pretty playable.\n\nI'd like to note though that on my first attempt of running the game I was using the 384.130 version of the Nvidia driver and the game completely failed to launch. More specifically, the game appeared as \"running\" on the Steam client but nothing really happened.\n\nAfter upgrading to the latest driver from the backports repository, which at the time of the writing was 390.77, it worked perfectly though. So, be sure to do that if you're also running Stretch.",

Fix - just install DirectX manually, using DXSETUP.exe, which is located in \"~/.steam/steam/steamapps/common/The Witcher 3/_CommonRedist/DirectX/Jun2010/\".\n\nBugs: \n1) When you Alt-Tab to minimize the game and then go back into the game, it is stuck on a still image. Workaround - Alt-Tab again to the game.\n2) When you Shift-Tab to go to the Steam Overlay, you cannot see the mouse cursor there.\n3) NVIDIA HairWorks does not work.",
