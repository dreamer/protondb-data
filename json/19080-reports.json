    "notes": "The game works perfectly, but only in a window. Fullscreen mode only showed the top-left quarter of the screen. If you try it, Alt-Enter will get you back to windowed mode since you can't operate the settings menu. If you have a 4K screen, windowed mode would be way too small and so this would drop to Bronze level.",
