Campaign/quick battle work well. Multiplayer untested.\nSteps taken to get working:\nCreate 32-bit WINE prefix to install icodecs to (and to ensure sound works correctly):\n$> WINEPREFIX=\"$HOME/wine32\" WINEARCH=win32 wine wineboot\n\nWith 32-bit prefix set as default prefix, install icodecs:\n$> winetricks icodecs\n\nThe intro movies do not work on Linux, run the game from terminal using wine (rather than Steam client) like so:\n$> wine Conquest.exe /skipmovies\n\nUncheck \"Enable DirectInput\" option in game to fix slow mouse issue and game is now fully playable for me with full sound and graphics.",
