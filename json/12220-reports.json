Minor graphical glitches in the sky and occasional flickering shadows. If framerates are low, lower visibility range. 1440p works fine for me, but some may have to go with 1080p for a smoother experience. Nvidia users may have to do some extra steps: https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/issues/350. Have Esync disabled always, since GTA V needed it, so that may be worth a try.",

On high settings (with draw distance and details set to the lowest) I'm getting 25-50fps depending on the area. There are some graphical glitches. I suggest turning off in-game V-Sync.
