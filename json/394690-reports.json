Some stutters are encountered in the lobby.\n\nPrevalent sound issues. Some incorrect sound effects are loaded (uses real gun effect for confetti gun) and some sounds are overbearingly loud.\n\nAreas such as casino overlap many sound effects and do not respect distance. All sound effects in these areas are projected as if a few feet away from your character and are extremely loud even with main volume set to 1%. Casino games do not play sound effects as they should when you press buttons.",
