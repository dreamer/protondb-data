    "notes": "The game itself runs as it should. Minor flaws: Alt-tabbing to desktop works but the desktop is so slow you can barely move the mouse. When alt-tabbing back to the game the input doesn't work so you have to alt-tab to it again to re-focus it, then it works again. Also, the game takes a very long time to start without any visual feedback (you might think it's broken but it's not, it just takes years). I gave it platinum only because no tweaks were needed to make it run.",
