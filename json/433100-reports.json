    "notes": "I had the game maxed out at a stable 25-35 fps but if you check the official system requirements I should be getting 60fps (even with the overhead applied) but the game is not well optimized at all or should I say, Unity games in general or just Proton doesn't like them. \n\nI also had extremely weird performance anomalies. Even though my fps was nowhere near where I should see stuttering, it \"stuttered\" while moving, it didn't matter if I was on the lowest or highest settings and remained the same weird phenomenon. I also had sequences where my fps suddenly tanked into single digits and I had to lower the settings just to get through, the worst offender was the 13th chapter with this. Outside of the \"dream/flashback\" sequences the performance remained consistent enough. Despite this I was able to finish the game nonetheless.",
