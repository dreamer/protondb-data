Temper your expectations accordingly.\n\nThe games is still not faithfully reproduced in it's entirety as there are some bugs here that are not present in Windows - most notably the directionality of sound is not always correct and certain dialog options take upward of 20 seconds to begin once the button is pressed.\n\nAll in all, very minor bugs - I expect this game will be Gold, and then Platinum, very soon.",
