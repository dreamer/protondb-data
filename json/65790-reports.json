Then direct3d is installed automatically and a preference sale appears (choose the game language, resolution, device type (Direct3D HW T&L, Direct3D or Glide), it recognizes me by default Direct3D HW T&L. Then the game starts (you can see the \"Bohemia\" logo for a little while) and then appears \"Bad Serial number given in Setup\" but I was never able to pre-enter my cd-key. So I don't know if it's stable and if it's a graphic error or not. \n\nI've tried this: Right click Arma Cold War Assault, Click Properties, Click Local Files, Click Verify Integrity of Game Cache. But then the same error still appears:  \"Bad Serial number given in Setup\".\n\nI am now testing the beta of the game ( Right click Arma Cold War Assault, Click Properties, Betas --> \"testing\")\n",
