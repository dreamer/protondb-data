    "notes": "Demoting this one to Stable: While it renders very smoothly and draws most graphical features perfectly, there is a problem with Gamma control not working. The Map screen shows only black lines where it should be light-grey/blue, making playing the game from the map screen very difficult. Also, the sound is...odd. Sometimes the correct sound effect doesn't play at the right time (e.g. engine noise), and even music can cut out.",
