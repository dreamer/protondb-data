    "notes": "Very long load times, sometimes has to be manually killed, and huge dips in fps, which can be triggered just by turning around. Putting the graphics settings at their lowest can improve this, but it's still a big problem. It doesn't crash and it's technically functional, but it's still unplayable as a game. HOWEVER, these performance issues can be almost entirely eliminated by setting \"PROTON_NO_D3D11=1 %command%\" as a launch option. Even with the graphics cranked all the way up, fps dips become almost unnoticeable. Almost. One final note: with said launch option, the slight fps dips are always slight, regardless of the graphics settings.",
