    "notes": "Any mouse movement also adds negative Y mouse movement to the vector. If you move mouse right, it'll be down-right. if you move the mouse left, it'll be down-left. if you move the mouse up, it won't move unless you're moving it fast enough. Controller support doesn't seem to work.\n\nOn a fresh save I can get 60fps using GoldenEye graphics settings, along with everything turned on with view distance at max, except for when you're facing certain directions (which is normal) at which point it drops down to about 30. Couldn't see any graphical issues although they may arise when it rains/etc; didn't test.",
