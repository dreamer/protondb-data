    "notes": "This game boots out of the box. It has several issues:\n* There is a slight noticeable amount of audio latency. This is something which is relatively important since this is a rhythm game. Additionally\n* Any interaction with the Steam overlay while this game is running will cause it to freeze.\n* After completing a song, the game freezes\n\nIt is possible to play this game relatively comfortably for 1 song but then it needs to be restarted.",
