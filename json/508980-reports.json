Instruction below:\n\nIf after the first installation the game starts with a black screen and just sound,\nOpen in your text editor of choice the following file: \"steamapps/compatdata/508980/pfx/drive_c/users/steamuser/Local Settings/Application Data/Crashday/config/graphics.config\"\nChange the value of \"FSAA\" from 2 to 0\n\nAfter that, the game should run fine. It can sometimes crash during startup or while loading a level but I've only experienced such a crash once and I've beat the entire campaign. The initial startup screen shows 2 buttons with no text, select the left one to play. The second button opens a steam workshop mod manager which sadly crashes when you have any mods installed, so mods don't work.",
