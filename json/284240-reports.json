    "notes": "Tested ~2 hours of gameplay. Had mouse, stutter and sound crackling issues, setting PROTON_NO_ESYNC=1 fixed it. Perfomance is as bad as on Windows. Sometimes short freezes (but if I remember correctly these also occured on Windows). Menu controls feel unresponsive, changing settings feels glitched sometimes, but all this is also the case on Windows. So \"Gold\" because after the tweak it runs the \"same\" as on Windows for me.",
