With ryzen taskset -c 0-7 was used to make it perform better. It seems to cap the framerate to 60FPS, as proton reports my monitor as 60Hz, even though its 144hz, regular wine detects it fine. framerate sometimes locks down to 50 or 45 when it has few shader caching stutters, it will lock itself back to 60 after some time or when bringing up the menu. Multiplayer worked also, did not test for long though, was able to join a server and was running around 10 min. Input works, chat works. Only place where you cant type is when you create your character, can't type the name.",
