    "notes": "Game itself is very stable (played for couple of hours, not a single crash) but the FPS is very low: 14 in villages, 20 outside making gameplay less pleasurable. Changing screen/picture settings doesn't seem to have any influence on it. Also, changing colors balance doesn't seem to have any effect so not everything works as intended. Game is playable thou.",
