Performance is abysmal for a game that looks like Oblivion but it's the same on Windows. 1440p, medium preset with ultra textures and increased draw distance -> 35-58 fps, slideshow when shaders are compiling. Patch 1, 3+ hours of gameplay. Would be platinum but automatic detection of graphical settings produces settings that have to be tweaked to get playable framerates so gold it is then.",
