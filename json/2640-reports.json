    "notes": "Unsurprisingly it has the same problems as the main game. It starts with \"MESA_EXTENSION_MAX_YEAR=2008 DRI_PRIME=1 %command%\" start commands, but has multiple problems running. In fullscreen mode it is too dark and the brightness cannot be setup, the main menu has screwed rendering in fullscreen mode, and vsync results in stuttered rendering of the game. All this can be avoided by playing in windowed mode, deactivating vsync and using this console command (console has to be activated in settings first): \"/com_maxfps 60\". this can also be a very helpful command: \"/cg_drawfps 1\"\n",

Game is darker then it should be due to the gamma boost not working. But the game appears to be fully playable.   ",
