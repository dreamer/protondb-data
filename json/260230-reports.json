    "notes": "Game itself seems to work great (60 fps) - only problematic part is forcing Uplay to work. You need following: 1) Let game install and wait for Uplay to complain about no connection. 2) Use protontricks to install corefonts. 3) Create symbolic link for libgnutls.so.26 (see Quake Champions issue to learn how to do this: https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/issues/225). The trick is: you need to create link in both /usr/lib and /usr/lib64 (I don't know how Ubuntu-derived distros handle this)). 4) Restart game, log-in/register to Uplay; Uplay will want to install Steam for windows for some reason (let it do it, just in some new directory); 5) DO NOT let Uplay start Windows Steam after installation. 6) After game starts - open Uplay settings and disable Uplay overlay (because Shift-F2 does not work). Restart game and it should be perfect. I am using Wine D3D11 only because my laptop does not support Vulkan. Looking forward to playing this title :)",
