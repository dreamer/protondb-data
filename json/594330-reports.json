    "notes": "Works perfectly after some tweaks! If you have a NVIDIA card, the game will attempt to call NVAPI in some scenes which will drastically reduce performance due to said calls failing. From what I noticed, this happens when looking at both candles and rain. \n\nTo fix this, you need to spoof your GPU as an AMD card so it won't call the NVAPI. To do this, locate the game's .exe files in steamapps/common/Visage/Visage/Binaries/Win64 and steamapps/common/Visage. In both locations, create a new text file called \"dxvk.conf\". Then, put these lines in both files.\n\ndxgi.customDeviceId = E366\ndxgi.customVendorId = 1002\n\nThis fixed the extreme lag I was experiencing in the game and now it's flawless. If it wasn't given already, this only applies if you have a NVIDIA card.",
