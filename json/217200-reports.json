    "notes": "At installation it notices you are using wine and asks if you want to set some settings to make it more compatble, when you say no it wont run, When i say yes it installs fine I guess you can play, and it runs stable, But it refuses to go in full screen, no matter what settings you provide. if you move the window the game stays in spot, very hard to explain. you can move the window back to see the game again, my guess it is an easy fix, but changing the wrong setting  makes it stop running.",
