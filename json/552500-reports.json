    "notes": "To run game you must activate the beta version called \"temporary_launcher_workaround\". The game runs smooth, BUT the first time you enter a game it will stutter alot. It seems that whenever the game loads a new asset (like a new enemy type), it will make stutter/hang for half a second, probably doing some cache operations or similiar. After I played about 15 minutes it ran extremely smooth (GTX 970, with custom settings i had a stable 100 FPS). The problem however is that any operations requiring connection with online server will give you an error message and exit the game. So the only thing you can really do is play with bots. BUT, you won't be able to level up and after the game has finished you will also get the error message and be forced to close the game. So I give the game a bronze because the game itself works very good, but due to the EasyAntiCheat you can't really do much progress except than playing with bots and earn no XP/upgrades.",
