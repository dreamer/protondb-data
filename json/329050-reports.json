Somehow, the performance is even worse than it is in vanilla WINE- quite unplayable at least on Mesa.\n\nMuch worse than this, however, is that the HUD for Vergil and Trish causes the screen to turn black. Since the new playable characters are the main reason for choosing the Special Edition over DMC 4 Vanilla, this significantly hurts the game's playability.\n\nUpdating DXVK to a version that supports D3D10 or using DXUP may remedy these issues.",
