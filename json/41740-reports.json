    "notes": "Overall it is very much playable.\nPerformance is lower then on Windows.\nIt seems that fps does not depend on graphics settings. Both Low and High settings gives 13-20 fps underwater and 25-60 fps in other places.\nThe more your play session is the more are random fps drops. Sometimes it stays on 1 fps for several seconds.\nIt seems that fps is more stable with PROTON_NO_ESYNC=1 but sound becomes cracked sometimes.\n\nMusicTool does not run and gives a message \".NET Framework 2.0 is not installed\".",
