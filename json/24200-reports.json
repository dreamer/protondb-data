    "notes": "Pretty much everything was tested such as the launcher, logging in. character creation, loading preexisting characters, in game steam transactions, questing, raids, PvP and all other content I've played. Performance is on par with windows and gamepads (XBOX One, Steam and PS4 controllers) are perfect. The only problem is stability. The game will eventually crash. I've played for a few minuets and it crashed and I've played for a few hours then it crashed. It's always ends in a crash requiring a manual kill of wine to get back to the desktop. If you're just questing it's fine (although annoying) to suffer a crash as your progress is saved server side. Doing anything like instances or PvP is not so good to crash as you will log back in kicked from what you were doing. DC Universe Online is a solid Bronze and will rate higher as stability improves.",
