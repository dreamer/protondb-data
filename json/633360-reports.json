    "notes": "The game boots up just fine but you need to apply the xact, xaudio2_7 winecfg patches otherwise the sound crackles and ticks constantly. Also, none of the video cut scenes play at all so you end up playing with practically no context as to what is happening story-wise, which ruins the game for me. Other than that it runs \"OK\", performance is a little underwhelming but acceptable.\n\nNote for Steam Controller users: You might want to change the RS settings from \"Joystick Move\" to \"Joystick Camera\", I found this to be a more pleasant experience.",
