    "notes": "Unfortunately I have to downgrade my previous rating due to the following issues:\n\nPerformance: continuous play, on \"Madness\" amount of planes, on the Zurich airport, after 280/300 planes: frames per seconds dropped significantly, and very sluggish input. I think it could lead up to crashes later on. I just shut the game down and restarted fresh.\n\nError: Maybe some kind of memory leak in Wine/Proton? The game isn't demanding graphically or computationally, I think. So there must be something else that's lowering performance over time.",
