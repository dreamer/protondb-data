    "notes": "Performance: good. Some slight FPS drops sometimes, it seems, but am not 100% sure of that.\nLoading times for pinball tables seem slightly longer than I remembered from Windows, still loads up quite fast (10-15 seconds on my SSD).\n\nError: Slight audio crunch/weirdness when loading a pinball table, this is only for 0,5 seconds or so, and it goes away automatically.\n\nDLC-addons: I've tested some of my Pinball DLC tables: Plants Vs Zombies, Rome, they worked  fine. \n\nPreview tables function: I've also tried the preview function of pinball tables I don't own (for me this was for example: American Dad) and this loaded up just as expected.\n\nThe options menu works as expected, also anti-aliasing functions work.\n\nController support: tested my Xbox360 controller, this worked great. Nudging the table works, the flippers are snappy.",
