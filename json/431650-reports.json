    "notes": "At first run I couldn't click on any main menu options with a controller or keyboard.  Once I shut everything down (thinking that it just didn't work) and came back to it a few hours later, this issue was gone.  The game mostly runs fine.  I had to turn off SSAO to get it to run somewhat smoothly.  Even after that, it suffers from intermittent \"micro\" stutters -- bouncing back and forth between smooth gameplay and slight stuttering.",
