    "notes": "First time setup took abnormally long, and then it paused indefinitely on \"Preparing to launch.\" Terminal is spamming \"eventfd: Too many open files.\"\n\nRunning steam with ulimit -n 4096 fixed that problem, but then it gets past that part and just hangs again before the window is created. No abnormal error messages in the Terminal.\n\nAfter that, I killed all wine/proton-related processes and tried launching again. It goes through the first time setup again, and then promptly crashes.
