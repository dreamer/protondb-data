    "notes": "Game seems to be working at first but there is some sort of a memory leak. The same happens when using Wine install. Game is choppy and laggy,. The longer it is played the worse it gets and at some point it almost freezes (especially with further maps). Switching graphic settings resets it and game runs fluently for a moment then becomes laggy pretty quickly and it's all over again. Game is unplayable that way.",
