The only visual error I had was excessive tearing. I'm fine with a little bit, but in this game it was much worse than I've seen before. Enabling VSync did not help.\n\nUnfortunately I didn't play any longer than 5 minutes due to my mouse jumping randomly every now and then. Everything seemed fine but I'm rating it 'Bronze' because of this because it's not a fun experience as it stands right now with that issue.",
