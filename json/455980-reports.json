    "notes": "The game installs normally. At launch I was met with a black screen, but I could skip it, set language, and made it to the title screen. The main menu appears to function correctly.  When you create a new game I found more black screens where the cutscenes should be but I could skip those too. The graphics and sound otherwise appear to function correctly. I played the game for a few minutes before I realized I couldn't set gather limits in the colony management window which was a big problem. None of the Proton commands helped and PROTON_NO_D3D11 caused the game to crash before reaching the title screen.",
