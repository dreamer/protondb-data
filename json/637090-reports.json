    "notes": "\"Performance is the same as on Windows, but the game will only work with two workarounds:\n\n1) It must be launched with the '-force-glcore' parameter\n2) The CCCP codec pack must be installed in the Proton prefix as follows.\n\na) Download the CCCP latest 32 and 64 bit codecs from cccp-project.net\nb) Navigate to the folder where the .exes are located and open a terminal\nc) Run the following commands. An installer will appear for each of them.\nWINEPREFIX=\"\"$HOME/.steam/steam/steamapps/compatdata/637090/pfx\"\" wine Combined-Community-Codec-Pack-2015-10-18.exe\n\nWINEPREFIX=\"\"$HOME/.steam/steam/steamapps/compatdata/637090/pfx\"\" wine Combined-Community-Codec-Pack-64bit-2015-10-18.exe\nd) Enjoy BATTLETECH\n\nSo far the game has been tested vanilla and with the latest RogueTech. I am not sure if the mod injector itself works, since I copied the files over from Windows, but after the modified Assembly-CSharp.dll has been created everything runs as expected.\n\nBUGS: Sound distortion while loading missions, but only on the loading screen. After the 'BEGIN MISSION' button is pressed the sound is normal.\"",
